As we have seen in the lecture videos, the dot product of vectors has a lot of applications. Here, you will complete some exercises involving the dot product.
We have seen that the size of a vector with two components is calculated using Pythagoras' theorem, for example the following diagram shows how we calculate the 
size of the orange vector r = (r1, r2)
In fact, this definition can be extended to any number of dimensions; the size of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.
Using this information, what is the size of the vector s=(1 3 4 2)

Ans--> sqrt(30)

2.
Remember the definition of the dot product from the videos. For two component vectors, 
a.b = a1.b1 + a2.b2 +.....+ an.bn
What is the dot product of the vectors r =(-5 3 2 8) and s =(1 2 -1 0)

Ans--> r.s = -1

3.
The lectures introduced the idea of projecting one vector onto another. The following diagram shows the projection of s onto r when the vectors are in two dimensions:Remember that the scalar projection is the size of the green vector. If the angle between 
s and r is greater than Ï€/2 the projection will also have a minus sign.
We can do projection in any number of dimensions. Consider two vectors with three components, r =( 3 -4 0) s= (10 5 -6)
What is the scalar projection of s onto r?

Ans--> 2

4.
Remember that in the projection diagram, the vector projection is the green vector: r =( 3 -4 0) s= (10 5 -6)
What is the vector projection of s onto r?

Ans --> (6/5 -8/5 0)

5.
Let a =(3 0 4) b=(0 5 12)
which is larger |a+b| or |a|+|b|

Ans--> |a+b|<|a|+|b|

6.
Which of the following statements about dot products are correct?

Ans--> 1.The size of the vector is eqaul to the square root of the dot product of vector itself
2. The vector projection of s onto r is equal to the scalar projection of s onto r multiplied by a vector of unit length that points in the same direction as r
