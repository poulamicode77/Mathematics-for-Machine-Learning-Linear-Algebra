1.
This aim of this quiz is to familiarise yourself with vectors and some basic vector operations.

For the following questions, the vectors a,b,c,d and e refer to those in this diagram:
The sides of each square on the grid are of length 1.What is the numerical representation of the vector a?

--> (2,2)

2.
Which vector in the diagram corresponds to 
[
âˆ’
1
2
]

--> vector d

3.
What vector is 2c?

--> (2,2) and a

4.
What vector is -b?

--> (-1,2) and d

5.
In the previous videos you saw that vectors can be added by placing them start-to-end. For example, the following diagram represents the sum of two new vectors,u + v:
The sides of each square on the grid are still of length 1. Which of the following equations does the diagram represent?

--> u = (2,1) and v = (0,1). So u+v = (2,2)

6.
Let's return to our vectors defined by the diagram below: What is the vector b + e?

--> (-1,-1)

7.What is the vector d-b?

--> (-2,4)
